## Motivation

* get "real" memory usage of the JVM beyond its managed parts
* get ahold of that info from within the JVM in environments where you can't
  instrument from the outside (e.g. PaaS)

## Usage

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.mweirauch</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-jvm-extras</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
    /* Plain Java */
    final MeterRegistry registry = new SimpleMeterRegistry();
    new ProcessMemoryMetrics().bindTo(registry);
    new ProcessThreadMetrics().bindTo(registry);
```
```java
    /* With Spring */
    @Bean
    public MeterBinder processMemoryMetrics() {
        return new ProcessMemoryMetrics();
    }

    @Bean
    public MeterBinder processThreadMetrics() {
        return new ProcessThreadMetrics();
    }
```

## Available Metrics

### ProcessMemoryMetrics

`ProcessMemoryMetrics` reads process-level memory information from `/proc/self/smaps`.
All `Meter`s are reporting in `bytes`.
Please note that `procfs` is only available on Linux-based systems.

* `process.memory.vss`: Virtual set size. The amount of virtual memory the process can access.
   Mostly useles, but included for completeness sake.
* `process.memory.rss`: Resident set size. The amount of process memory currently in RAM.
* `process.memory.pss`: Proportional set size. The amount of process memory currently in RAM,
  accounting for shared pages among processes. This metric is the most accurate in
  terms of "real" memory usage.
* `process.memory.swap`: The amount of process memory paged out to swap.
* `process.memory.swappss`: The amount of process memory paged out to swap accounting for
  shared memory among processes. Since Linux 4.3. Will return `-1` if your
  kernel is older. As with `pss`, the most accurate metric to watch.

### ProcessThreadMetrics

`ProcessThreadMetrics` reads process-level thread information from `/proc/self/status`.
Please note that `procfs` is only available on Linux-based systems.

* `process.threads`: The number of process threads as seen by the operating system.

## Notes

* `procfs` data is cached for `100ms` in order to relief the filesystem pressure
  when `Meter`s based on this data are queried by the registry one after
  another on collection run.
* Snapshot builds are pushed to [Sonatype Nexus Snapshot Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/github/mweirauch/micrometer-jvm-extras/) on successful `master` builds.
